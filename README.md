# sudokusolverCNN
A CNN model trained on modified MNIST dataset, which takes a sudoku board as input and reads it. The solution of the puzzle is then printed on the same image.

The dataset for the CNN is the MNIST data. But in order to make the model robust for empty cells, I added additional data rows. 
Currently the image processing is not apt for live input feed. It will be added in futher versions.
